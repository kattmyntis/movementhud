# MovementHUD
A versatile SourceMod plugin providing customizable displays for player movement.

## **Installation**
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Sikarii/movementhud/releases)
2. Extract all the files into `csgo`

> :warning: **If you are using KZTimer**: This doesn't work.


## **Differences**
- Is now fully integrated into GOKZ, no tracking module required.
- MHUD options in `!options` removed, however still available with !mhud as usual.
- Add first tick gain indicator (usually indicating W release and strafe key press at the same time)
- Fix MHUD key display wiggling around, especially with mouse display on for 1080p/1440p resolutions
- Fix MHUD display taking over GOKZ's display, hiding features like race announcements
- Better GOKZ replay bot integration
- Add more color by speed options
- Slightly increase display quality in return for rare flickering.
